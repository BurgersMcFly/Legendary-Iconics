# Legendary Iconics

Every Iconic weapon is legendary. Includes looted and crafted variants. Divided into two files to customize your experience.

Crafting works like the vanilla game but every recipe looks like it requires the same legendary weapon.

E.g. If you use the Full version of the mod in order to craft the Epic Cocktail Stick you need the normal/looted version (which is a legendary with the mod) and in order to craft the third legendary Cocktail Stick you need the epic version (which is a legendary with this mod).

Using [Crafting Quality of Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4453?tab=description) is recommended but not a requirement.

You don't have to loot or craft the weapons again for this mod to take effect.
